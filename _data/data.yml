    title: Academic Projects
    intro: |
        I have written papers based on Machine Learning. The first employs the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using Keras Sequential API to be able to detect skin
        cancer from images of skin growths. The second paper compares the performance of 4 classification algorithms and applies hyperparameter tuning on the model with the 
        highest accuracy. The third paper is how a chatbot is created that learns responses via ML techniques.
